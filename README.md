## Setup

### Local Development
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Create a `.env` file with your Hugging Face API token:
   ```
   HF_API_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ```
4. Run the application: `python app.py`

### Replit Deployment
1. Fork this repository to your Replit account
2. In Replit, go to the "Secrets" tab (ðŸ”’ icon)
3. Add a new secret:
   - Key: `HF_API_TOKEN`
   - Value: Your Hugging Face API token
4. Click "Run" to start the application

## Security Note
- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits
- For Replit, use the Secrets feature instead of `.env` files
